        <h2>Mobile Money and SMEs</h2>
        <p>
            In Kenya, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a vital role in the economy, with over 7.4 million MSMEs employing approximately 14.9 million Kenyans and contributing around 40% to the GDP, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).<br>
         The need for quick transactions spurred the emergence of mobile money, benefiting SMEs significantly by facilitating social and business networks while reducing the need for physical journeys, as confirmed by previous studies.

        <h2>Transcation Costs</h2>
        <p>
            As much as mobile money created a positive effect on SMEs, it did come with a negative outcome too.
            Companies that offer this service tend to charge high transcation costs. This heaps business owners with
            a new burden.
